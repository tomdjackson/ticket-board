# Ticket Board

For managing your Todo lists.

- Frontend built on NextJS with Apollo
- Backend built on express-apollo with Mongodb
- JWT Auth

## Prereqs
- Mongodb running locally on port 27017
- Nodejs

## Running:
Once MongoDB is running, both frontend and backend need to be started. These can be run in 'dev' mode for now. In seperate terminal windows, run the following:

```
cd backend
npm i
npm run dev
```

```
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

## TODO:
- Error Handling
- Move JWT storage to cookies
- Styling
- Tests
